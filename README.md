# Welcome to Flarates

In this repository you fill find a series of tools and tutorials on how to process and estimate the cumulitive rate of stellar flare rates for TESS and Kepler light curves. This repository will benefit from the following repositories: 

- Stella (stellar flare idneitification, equivalent duration estimations, flare duration)
- Lightkurve (fetch Kepler and TESS data)
- FFD (generate FFD plots)
